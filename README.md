# Save the King

The game has a number of levels with increasing difficulty.
At each level the goal is to reach the throne with the king. 
In order to do this the player has to overcome various obstacles.

Each character has different abilities and the player needs to work with all of them together to complete the level.


There are also enemies in the form of dwarves who move around the level, some moving randomly and some following the player and trying to block him.


At each stage there are also a random number of gifts, some good gifts like extra time or disappearing the dwarves and some bad gifts like reducing time.
